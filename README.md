To install, first get the TamperMonkey Chrome extension: [HERE](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)  

For Gex install, you just go to the raw page for gex_script.user.js: [HERE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SainTfactor/Gex-Enter-the-Ginkgo/master/gex_script.user.js)  
Hit "Install", and you should be good to go.

# Chronos Trigger

A userscript for making the vmware web view interaction interface more user friendly.

I'm just rehosting the Chronos Trigger plugin with minor fixes (since stuff has changed since initial development).  It's basically all the tools you need for the virtual environment.

All credit where credit is due, here's the original Chronos Trigger: https://github.com/bryfry/chronos_trigger
